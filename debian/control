Description: tool for installing and configuring server applications
 shak is a tool for managing the deployment of multiple applications to a
 server, usually a personal one. It allows users without technical
 knowledge to maintain their own servers at home or in the cloud. shak is
 opininated; it will setup applications based on distribution packages,
 and in the most secure way possible.
 .
 shak IS STILL ALPHA SOFTWARE, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION YET.
